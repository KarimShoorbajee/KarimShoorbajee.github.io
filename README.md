# THIS PROJECT USES DATA FROM NOAA WHICH IS NO LONGER HOSTING ITS HTTP SERVERS BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN

This is where I'm currently hosting an environmental science project. It uses the NOAA 30 year normal study to map average temperatures by 
month across the continetnal united states.

It retrieves the longitudinal and latitudinal location of over 500 weather stations in the continental united states and uses the mapbox api
to map them.

Monthly temperature averages are then used to select a color which represents a level of temperature which is then mapped as dots 
onto the weather stations
